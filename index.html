            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <p>When I was younger, I discovered a deep passion for religion. While my parents and religious leaders have told me to pick just one, I love Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism too much to do so. My faith has gotten me through the darkest times of my life, including my 227-day-long stranding in the Atlantic ocean.</p>

            <h3>Animals</h3>
            <p>I grew up in the Pondicherry Zoo in India. I got to know the habits and personalities of a wide variety of animals. My father taught my brother Ravi and I to be especially afraid of tigers, which did end up benefitting me in the end.</p>

            <h3>Swimming</h3>
            <p>My grandfather, Francis Adirubasamy, named my after the famous Piscine Molitor pool located in Paris. He was a very passionate swimmer, and trained me from a young age. We first started in the pool, and I was excited to graduate to the ocean.</p>

        <h2>Editor's Note</h2>
        <p>As for the general layout of the site, I stuck to earth-tones rather than the more obvious ocean theme. Even though the majority of Pi's story is focused around his time in the Atlantic, I believe he is a more down-to-earth person who obviously didn't choose to be stranded in the ocean. He would resonate with the birds in the main image (photographed in India) because he would rather be free than confined to a small lifeboat. I chose a religious temple icon in the upper left corner because he puts religion first in his life and would want that to be the first thing associated with his name. Lastly, I picked a green theme because it's Pi's favorite color, representing the vegetation he yearned for, and he also mentions that it's the color of Islam.<br><br>I chose religion, animals, and swimming as topics because those were his main interests before leaving India, and like I mentioned I don't believe that the boat tragedy defines his character or personality. I included a link to the religions of India because I believe he is proud of his history and would like to celebrate where he came from. The "zoo animal behaviors" link is indicative of his scientific mindset that is curious about the details and quirks of animals. Lastly, I chose a third link to a tutorial on creating swim workouts because Pi is a mathematical person who I imagine would spend lots of time planning out his training.
